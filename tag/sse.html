<h2><strong>Cascadia subduction zone creep</strong></h2>
<p>This blog is a continuation of the original <a class="reference external" href="http://geodesygina.com/Cascadia.html">'Why the Central Cascadia Subduction Zone is Creepy'</a> blog posted a few weeks ago. Many of the terms used in this post are defined in the previous post. My collaborators on this project are <a class="reference external" href="http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx07343/">Rob McCaffrey</a> at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State University</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ess.washington.edu/dwp/people/profile.php?name=creager--ken">Ken Creager</a> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>. The paper for which the blog is based is found <a class="reference external" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013GC005172/abstract">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Cascadia subduction zone is not just creepy, but it is creepy on many different levels (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>
<img alt="cat" class="align-center" src="/images/touch_my_tail.jpg" style="width: 300.0px; height: 300.0px;" />
<p><em>Figure 1.  I had to include this figure.  So funny, I laughed for hours, and I'm not even a fan of pet photos... Picture found at http://cheezburger.com/1384231168.</em></p>
<p>No, I don't mean that kind of creepy.  What I mean is that the tectonic plates that make up the Cascadia subduction zone between major earthquakes are in some places stuck together, but in others are partially creeping. My previous <a class="reference external" href="http://geodesygina.com/Cascadia.html">blog</a> talks about regions on the fault that are stuck (or 'locked'), and regions undergoing persistent fault creep, where persistent fault creep means just that -- between earthquakes the plates are constantly, slowly slipping.  However, there is yet another slip phenomenon that periodically occurs between earthquakes called slow slip, and is the topic of this blog. In an attempt to not get fault creep confused with slow slip, I will try to use the words persistent and periodic, respectively, when describing them in the text.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2</em> is a cross section of the Cascadia subduction zone and shows the Juan de Fuca plate subducting beneath the North America plate.  Close to the surface of the earth in the up-dip portion of the fault, the plates are stuck in between large earthquakes.  This is the region that is expected to rupture during the next big event.  Deeper and further down-dip the plates slide freely past each other.  Between these two regions, however, it was fairly recently discovered using continuously recording GPS that the two plates periodically slip over a period of weeks to months (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5521/1525">Dragert et al., 2001</a>), and in doing so accumulate enough slip to be equivalent to moment magnitude 6-7 earthquakes!  Interestingly, you can't physically feel these periodic slow slip events because they happen so slowly compared to an earthquake, which can last for a few seconds to minutes.  Major slow slip events happen every 10 months to 24 months, depending where you are observing along the subduction margin.  We will talk about that more a little later in the blog.</p>

The little devil guy, that is courtesy of too much coffee. Thanks to Aaron Wech for giving me the idea.</em></p>
<p>Not too much time after the discovery of periodic slow slip, it was observed that periodic slow slip is accompanied by what looks like noise on a single seismometer.  This 'noise' is found to be temporally consistent among multiple local seismometers (<em>Figure 3</em>). This temporally consistent 'noise' became known as non-volcanic tremor.</p>

<p>Soon scientists realized  what they were seeing wasn't noise at all -- it was actually a seismic signal generated from these periodic slow slip events (or SSEs). <em>Figure 4</em> demonstrates how well in time the non-volcanic tremor correlates with GPS detected periodic slow slip. The blue dots in <em>Figure 4</em> are the east component of position of a GPS site on Vancouver, WA.  The time series produces a saw-tooth pattern, signaling the the relative movement of the GPS monument reversed (and indicating an SSE).  The tremor activity is also plotted on <em>Figure 4</em> and indicates that the tremor peaks during these GPS detected slow slip events.</p>

<p><em>Figure 4. Modified from http://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/pprs-pprp/re/ETS-eng.php where they state: &quot;Small blue circles show the daily position of a GPS site near Victoria with respect to the interior of the North American plate. The continuous green line is the long term eastward motion of the site. The red saw-tooth line shows that detailed motion includes reversals in motion about every 14 months. The bottom black graph shows the number of hours of tremor activity observed on southern Vancouver Island.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The combination of periodic slow slip and non-volcanic tremor together was coined by the Canadian Geologic Survey as 'Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS)' (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnsn.org/tremor/rogers_ETS.pdf">Rogers and Dragert, 2003</a>).  Intriguingly, non-volcanic tremor and SSEs are not observed together or at all for all subduction zones, but that is a topic for another blog.</p>
<p>Subsequent studies have shown that in Cascadia ETS recurrence varies along the strike of the subduction zone.  <em>Figure 5</em>, (from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.intl-geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/35/10/907.abstract">Brudzinski and Allen, 2007</a>) color codes select continuously recording GPS (squares) and broadband seismometers (triangles) by how often they detect periodic slow slip and tremor, respectively.  Warmer colors indicate sites that detected them more often.  What <a class="reference external" href="http://www.intl-geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/35/10/907.abstract">Brudzinski and Allen, 2007</a> found is that ETS recurrence seems to be segmented along the margin, with ETS events happening every ~10 months in northern CA, ~24 months in central to northern Oregon, and about every 14 months in Washington (<em>Figure 5</em>).</p>
<img alt="Brudzinski_Allen" class="align-center" src="/images/Brudzinski_Allen_fig.png" style="width: 300.0px; height: 500.0px;" />
<p><em>Figure 5. Map of the Cascadia subduction zone modified from</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.intl-geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/35/10/907.abstract">Brudzinski and Allen, 2007</a>. <em>Squares and triangles represent locations of high precision GPS and broadband seismometers, respectively, and are colored by how often slip and tremor are detected.</em></p>
<p>So the recurrence of these events are not the same along the margin, but does that mean that the amount of tremor and slip along the margin also differ?  First, let's look at the tremor. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnsn.org/">Pacific Northwest Seismic Network</a>, operated out of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, keeps a continously updating catalog of tremor along the entire margin. For some interactive tremor fun, you might want to check out their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnsn.org/tremor">tremor mapping tool</a>.  <em>Figure 6</em> is a tremor density map -- in other words, it takes how many tremors were detected over a specified region, and applies that number to a color scale, which is then used to color the region.   Dark blue colors indicate regions where the tremor counts are higher.  Correlating well with the recurrence, the tremor counts for the time period of ~August 2009-August 2013 (2009.6-2013.6) are elevated where the recurrence time is shorter (<em>Figures 5 and 6</em>).</p>

<p>So what about the slow slip? Periodic slow slip over time is a little more difficult to estimate. This is because our observations are on the surface of the earth, but we really want to know what is going on down on the fault.  In order to figure that out, we will need to build a mechanical model, but we will get to that part in a minute.  For now, let's take a look at the data.  In <em>Figure 4</em> the east component of the GPS time series is shown.  The GPS time series in this figure has a slope (notice that the time series position starts at about 1996 at -5 mm, and ends in 2004 at about 28 mm).  This slope marks the long term velocity of the time series, which is illustrated in <em>Figure 4</em> as a green line.  Notice that in between slow slip events the slope is larger (red line), and indicates the inter-SSE velocity, which in Cacsadia seems to be pretty consistent between SSEs. To better visualize the GPS offsets from SSEs along the Cascadia subduction zone, the inter-SSE velocity is simply subtracted from the time series. <em>Figure 7</em> displays the time series for sites from Canada down to northern California.  Note that the SSEs (marked by jumps in the time series) are well defined and fairly frequent in the north, reduce in amplitude and recurrence as we enter Oregon, then pick up again as we move into southern Oregon and northern California.  South of about 40 degrees latitude SSEs are not detected.</p>

<p><em>Figure 7.  Map of inter-SSE GPS velocities (black arrows) with select GPS monuments labeled (a).

<p>So these GPS are observations made at the surface, but we would like to know how much periodic slow slip is occuring along the margin.</p>
<p>This is because the slip on the plate interface must be estimated by a mechanical model.  In the previous blog, I talk a little bit about what a mechanical model is.  Similar to the previous blog, I use the block modeling software TDEFNODE, which breaks up the region of interest into tectonic blocks (<em>Figure 8</em>) and the block rotations and deformation of the crust due to motion on the fault are solved. Unlike the previous model, this model also solves for the slip on the plate boundary for periodic slow slip events from 2005.5 to 2011.0.</p>
